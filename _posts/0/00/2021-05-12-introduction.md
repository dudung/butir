Item (interconnected terms explanation machine) is designed to enhance the visualization of interconnect terms to support their brief and concise explanation. It is more than a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) nor a [concept map](https://ctl.byu.edu/tip/concept-mapping), made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and can be cloned from [Github](https://github.com/dudung/item) then customized to match everyone particular need. 

This fourth version is due to covering more topics other than physics and progrmming.
