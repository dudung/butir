Item is a abbreviation of interconnected terms explanation machine, which is designed how to enhance the visualization of interconnect terms to support their single explanation. It is more than a wiki nor a concept map, made using Jekyll, and can be cloned from [Github](https://github.com/dudung/item) to suit everyone particular need. 

This fourth version is due to covering more topics other than physics and progrmming.
