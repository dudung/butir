Item (interconnected terms explanation machine) is designed to enhance interconnectitivy of terms to support their brief and concise explanation. It is more than a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) nor a [concept map](https://ctl.byu.edu/tip/concept-mapping), made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and can be cloned from [Github](https://github.com/dudung/item) then customized to match everyone particular need. 

<div class="nodes">0010</div> This fourth version is due to covering more topics other than physics and progrmming. Notice that black rectangle with white number on the right represents a node with link to another item related to this item (post). For this post only the top right nodes are only for illustration and might not be interconnected to this post. The illustration holds also for JavaScript (JS) supports, e.g. MathJax, Chart.js, etc, as listed on the top of this page.
